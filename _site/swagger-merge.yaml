# This file is used to merge OpenAPI properties into the local swagger source
# when generating the API Reference. This file is only necessary when there are important public docs updates
# that need to go live before they are merged into the public swagger spec. If you are
# adding fields here, you should also create a ticket to get those fields
# permanently added here, then remove them when they are live.



# Example: add a new component

# components:
#   examples:
#     collectMemberInfoInvalid:
#       value:
#         verificationId: '111111111111111111111111'
#         currentStep: collectMemberPersonalInfo
#         submissionUrl: /rest/v2/verification/111111111111111111111111/collectMemberPersonalInfo
#         errorIds: [ 'invalidEmail' ]
#         segment: member
#         subSegment: null


# Example: Change summaries and descriptions

# paths:
#   /info:
#     get:
#       summary: New information has come to light!
