Welcome to the MySheerID Getting Started guide! In this section, you will:


1. Create an account or access your existing account: [Account Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/getting-started/account-setup.md %})
1. Design your first verification program using our program builder: [Design Program]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/getting-started/design-program.md %})
1. Install your newly created test program on your website, using either a code snippet or URL that we provide: [Install Program]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/getting-started/install.md %})
1. Test your program using test consumer data to simulate verification success and failure as well as your consumer messaging copy for each step in a verification workflow: [Test Program]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/getting-started/test-program.md %})

If you have made it through the above steps, congratulations! Now you should understand the basics of creating and installing a verification program, and take the next
steps toward launching your consumer offer.

Let's head to the [Manage Programs]({{ 'manage-programs' | relative_url }})
 to learn about the advanced SheerID features, e.g., campaign tracking, SMS and email notifiers, and prepare
your program to go live.
