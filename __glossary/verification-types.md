* `AUTHORITATIVE`—indicates that SheerID has attempted to find a match within one of our authoritative data providers. 
* `ASSET REVIEW`—indicates that no authoritative verification was attempted and the verification was performed via Document Review. 
* `AUTHORITATIVE, ASSET REVIEW`—indicates that SheerID did not find a match within one of our authoritative data providers, and the individual then uploaded a document for Document Review Verification.
