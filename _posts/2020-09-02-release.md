## Added the Registered Military Dependent option to MySheerID

Verifying the family of military members, known as Registered Military Dependents, has always been possible with the help of our staff. Now weâ€™ve made it easier to do this yourselves in MySheerID. While this subsegment is not included by default it can be added to any new military program. Program admins can use the [Program Settings]({{ 'manage-programs/program-settings#eligible-subsegments' | relative_url }}) section of their military program(s) to include Registered Military Dependents in their offer.
