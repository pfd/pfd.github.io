## Campaign Reporting

Campaign Reporting is a set of features that allows you to see data from the impact of your marketing campaigns on SheerID verification volumes. There are 3 important pieces to campaign reporting:

1. A [program setting]({{ 'manage-programs/program-settings#campaign-tracking' | relative_url }}) which automatically recognizes campaign parameters in verification URLs and stores them with verification requests as metadata
1. New [filters]({{ 'reporting#advanced-filters' | relative_url }}) and charts in the MySheerID Dashboard to visualize the data associated with the `utm_campaign` metadata key
1. Inclusion of the metadata from any of the 5 main campaign tracking parameters in downloadable reports from MySheerID

All new programs created after todayâ€™s release have the [Program Setting]({{ '/manage-programs/program-settings#campaign-tracking' | relative_url }}) to enable campaign tracking turned on. You can also turn it on for any existing programs.

Once enabled, include `utm_campaign` and any other UTM parameters with your URLs and we will store the values with each request. Visit the [Reporting]({{ 'reporting#campaign-tracking' | relative_url }}) section to learn more about how campaign data appears in the MySheerID Dashboard.
