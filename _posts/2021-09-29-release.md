## Hosted Landing pages

All new programs now include a new landing page feature to help you launch your offer quickly. Your programâ€™s landing page provides a place where you can grab consumer interest with interesting imagery, describe your offer, and invite consumers to get verified. The feature includes:

* A mobile-responsive page optimized for conversion on all devices
* Open graph tags and functionality to enable easy sharing of the offer via email, SMS, and social networks
* Support for easy tracking of traffic sources through inclusion of metadata in URL query parameters
* Editing of all page text in MySheerID
