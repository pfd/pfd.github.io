## Counts added to Dashboard

We continue to make improvements to the new Dashboard in MySheerID based on your feedback. This release we added the ability to hover over any section of the circle charts to see the count for that section.

## History view in Search Tool

We updated the Search tool in MySheerID. You can now view a consumerâ€™s verification activity ordered by date and time for a comprehensive view of what happened and when. All document review and notification activity are presented in a single list, starting with the most recent activity.

## Addition of Last Login date to MySheerID

We now track the last login date of each user and display it in MySheerID. User Admins can visit the Users tab under Settings to see who has been active on the site and when. This will help you with security compliance around limiting access to current employees.
