## New, simplified, powerful reporting endpoints

Now you can generate a verification report which can be downloaded later, check the
status of the report, and retrieve it when it is ready.

Use the [Generate a verification report Report]({{ 'rest-api#operation/generateVerificationReport' | relative_url }}){:target="blank"} endpoint to define the start and end dates for the report:

```http
POST /rest/v2/report/verification HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"startDate": "2019-08-06",
	"endDate": "2019-08-08",
	"format": "CSV"
}
```

Use the status endpoint to [retrieve your verification status]({{ 'rest-api#operation/getReportStatus' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}:

```http
GET /rest/v2/report/{reportId}/status HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

```

And finally, [retrieve data for a previously-generated report]({{ 'rest-api#operation/getReportData' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} in CSV format:

```http
GET /rest/v2/report//report/{reportId} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Update verification metadata endpoint

Now you can [update verification metadata]({{ 'rest-api#operation/updateVerificationMetadata' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"} for an ongoing verification.


```http
PUT /rest/v2/verification​/{verificationId}​/metadata HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

{
  "key": "value",
  "anotherKey": "another value"
}
```

## Capture IP address in a verification 

`ipAddress` is now an optional field in some verifications such as [Submit Student Verification]({{ 'rest-api#operation/submitStudentVerification' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}. You only need to provide an `ipAddress` in situations where the HTTP requests do not come directly from the end user.


```http
POST /rest/v2/verification/{verificationID}/step/collectStudentPersonalInfo HTTP/1.1
Host: services.sheerid.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
	"firstName": "Jane",
	"lastName": "Ivy",
	"birthDate": "1990-01-01",
	"email": "jane@albanylaw.edu",
	"ipAddress": "204.120.0.15",
	"organization": {
		"id": 4597,
		"name": "ALBANY LAW SCHOOL"
	}
}
```
