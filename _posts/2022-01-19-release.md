## Eligibility Step in Program Creation

To simplify setting the eligibility criteria for new offers, we moved the sub-segment selectors out of [Program Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/manage-programs/program-settings.md %}) and combined it with the Offer Name in a new *Eligibility* step.

{% include image.md name="Eligibility Release" %}

Now you will set the qualification criteria and a descriptive name for your offer during program creation. 

See [Eligibility]({{ 'getting-started/design-program#eligibility' | relative_url }}) for details.
