## Include Archived programs with Active in Dashboard

We received feedback that some customers wanted a single report that included all their active programs as well as past programs which they had archived. So we improved the filter UX to make it easier to choose which of your programs to include. We changed the menu item “All My Programs” to read “All Active Programs”. This remains the default selection. We added another option called “All Programs including Archived”. Choosing that option returns data for all your programs, active or not,  for the selected date range.
