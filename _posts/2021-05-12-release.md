## Refine organization search by city name

We added the ability to include a city name when searching for an organization in a verification form. For students attending schools with common names, such as Rosa Parks Elementary or Lincoln High School, this increases the consumer’s ability to quickly locate where they attend by appending their school’s city when searching.
