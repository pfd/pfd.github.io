## Improved communication on document review resolution

Communicating clear expectations to consumers using SheerID verification forms is a main emphasis of ours. In particular, when consumers need to upload documents to get verified we want to set the right expectations about how long it will take to review the submitted document. To address this goal we made several improvements to our JavaScript Library in this release. When a consumer reaches the document upload step, we now display:

- A clear error message if any uploaded files are too large
- A language-specific estimated wait time on the Doc Upload step
- A language-specific estimated and max wait time on the Reviewing step (see image below)

Also, if the verification form has an option to change the display language, the wait times are updated to reflect the chosen language.
