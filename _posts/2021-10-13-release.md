## PII Configuration for reporting

At the request of several clients, we added a feature whereby your account can be configured to only include certain named Personally Identifiable Information (PII) fields in reports. This allows you to exclude certain PII, such as date of birth, by asking SheerID staff not to include it in what is allowed. When configured, only PII fields which are listed in the configuration will be returned in any report from SheerID products and [APIs]({{ 'tutorials/verification-report' | relative_url }}). Any fields not included in the configuration will also appear as “Redacted” in the [Customer Service Search tool]({{ 'reporting/search#search-for-verifications' | relative_url }}).

Reach out to your CSM to discuss adding this configuration to your account.
