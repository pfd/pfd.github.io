## Localized Help Center content

In March we [launched a new Help Center]({{ 'news#updated-consumer-help-center' | relative_url }}) to improve the speed of resolution of consumer issues related to completing the verification process. Since this content is linked from verification forms that are localized into 36 different languages we added localization support for the Help Center content as well.
