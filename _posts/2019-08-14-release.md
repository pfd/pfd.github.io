## Download large verification reports in MySheerID

In prior releases, you may have experienced a timeout when downloading reports with
large amounts of data. We have addressed your feedback by implementing the following
two enhancements:

1. On the back end, we will no longer timeout your session while a report is downloading, no matter how long it takes.
1. On the front end, you will see the following spinner as a visual cue that the report is being generated:

{% include image.md name="Generating Report" %}

One the report is finished generating, it will trigger the download of the finished CSV file. 

{% include note.html content="We recommend selecting shorter date ranges if you think large amounts of data will be included." %}
