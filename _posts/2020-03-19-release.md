## Processing Timer for Document Review

We are always focused on speed. Since more and more of our document reviews happen quickly, we updated our consumer experience to keep the userâ€™s attention. All new 2.0 programs now include a screen with a 20 second timer. Once a user uploads a document, the timer counts down and flips to the appropriate approved or rejected message as soon as a decision is made.
