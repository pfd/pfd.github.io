## Verification Results reporting changes

In order to clarify our reporting on verification results, we changed our terminology in MySheerID dashboards and downloadable reports to display *Eligible* and *Ineligible* verifications. The terms are defined as:

Eligible
: The individual has been matched against at least one verification source and is verified to be eligible for your offer.

Ineligible
: The individual is not currently eligible for your offer  because they have not been verified against a verification source.

This change is present in the MySheerID [Reporting Dashboard]({{ 'reporting' | relative_url }}) as well as reports viewable from the [More Data]({{ 'reporting/more-data' | relative_url }}) area in MySheerID. Charts show these new values regardless of geography, program or timeframe chosen. We also added a new column labeled *Eligibility* to our downloadable reports, which includes these values for each verification. We did not remove the legacy *Results* column from the reports.

We also published a [new piece on Best Practices](https://view-su2.highspot.com/viewer/622fa77fe93ffaa2f6ed33de?mkt_tok=OTQ1LUdTTy0yNjMAAAGDLebDHE_Uo01yPCg2x_OCuMTXzf-wCye6nE1y7zAYEJO5slwFD7KVprrcvyls7wXaSXz6Lzy2QNBTX380eA) for reaching all interested consumers. We found that even ineligible consumers expressed strong intent to engage with your brand and shared valuable zero-party data with you.
