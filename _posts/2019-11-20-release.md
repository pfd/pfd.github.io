## Added doctors verification to the Medical segment

Now you can instantly verify doctors in the United States as part of the medical segment. Coverage has been added for over 1 million doctors, accounting for 99% of licensed medical and osteopathic physicians. Doctors verification can be configured as a standalone program, or paired with nurses as part of a larger medical program. We use authoritative data sources to instantly verify if an individual holds current licensure as a doctor in the US, verifying based off of name, birth date, postal code, and email.

## Updated Segment cards in MySheerID

We refreshed the statistics shown in MySheerIDâ€™s program builder to reflect our latest coverage, including doctors.
