## Canadian Military and First Responder Support

You asked us to support your heroes programs in Canada so we added support for military and first responder to the medical support we already offer. We can now create offers for you with Canada as a country option for all three segments. Military offers cover all branches of the Canadian military. First Responder programs feature a list of Canadian Police, Firefighter and EMT organizations, with support for users adding their own if needed.

For more detailed information on Canadian programs, please contact your Account Executive.

## Cross subdomain support for conversion tracking cookies

Conversion Tracking is a key pillar for tracking [the ROI of your SheerID programs]({{ '/reporting/more-data#roi-impact-dashboard' | relative_url }}). We've improved our [Simple Method]({{ '/tutorials/conversion-tracking#simple-method' | relative_url }}) of Conversion Tracking to support those of you  which have our verification form hosted on a different subdomain than your checkout page, for example verify.brand.com and shop.brand.com. We updated the cookie we use for to support this cross subdomain use case. To learn more about this and all our Conversion Tracking methods, visit [our tutorial in the Developer Center]({{ '/tutorials/conversion-tracking' | relative_url}}).
