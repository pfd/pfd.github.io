## Updated messaging when document language differs from form

[Last release]({{ '/news/2021/02/03/release/#improved-communication-on-document-review-resolution' | relative_url}}) we focused on setting the right expectations about how long it will take to review a document submitted during the verification process. This release, we added the ability to use the document’s detected language to update that messaging.

Prior to receiving a document, review turnaround times are based on the language the form is viewed in. However, once a document is received, we detect the document’s language and update the expected turnaround time if that language differs from the form.

## Enhanced support for right-to-left languages
Our JavaScript Library now renders forms with right-to-left alignment when dictated by the language chosen; for example forms in Arabic, Hebrew and others.

## Notifier delivery status in Customer Service Search
To further assist you when helping consumers, we added additional information on the delivery status of email and SMS notifiers to the [Customer Service Search]({{ '/reporting/search' | relative_url}}) tool.
