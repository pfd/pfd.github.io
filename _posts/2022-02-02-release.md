## Report Center and Scheduled Reporting

Using Report Center within the [Reporting Dashboard]({{ 'reporting#overview' | relative_url }}) will allow you to generate customized verification reports for immediate availability, download resulting data for internal use by your company, and schedule future reports to be run automatically at regular intervals of your choosing, ideal for tracking changing trends in the performance of your campaigns.
